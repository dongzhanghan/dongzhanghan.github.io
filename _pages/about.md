I am a first year Master student majoring in Computer Science at UC San Diego, advised by Prof. [Tzu-Mao Li](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/). My research interests lie in computer graphics(rendering, Monte Carlo sampling and variance analyse). 

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from The Chinese University of Hongkong(shenzhen) in 2023. During my undergraduate years, I worked at [X.Verse](https://www.xverse.cn/index.html) as a Graphics Engineer intern.
